## Project Overview

**Project Name:** PHAROS

**Acronym Composition:**
-   **P** - Pyro
-   **H** - Hydro
-   **A** - Analysis
-   **R** - Research
-   **O** - Open-source
-   **S** - Sentinel-data

## Purpose (The "WHY")

**Goal:** To provide a suite of open-source services to accelerate and operationalize satellite-based hydro-pyro hazard analysis for the research community.

**Target Audience:** Researchers in Earth Observation, Environmental Science, and Hazard Analysis.

## Scope (The "WHAT")

**Key Domains:** Pyro (Fire-related hazards), Hydro (water-related hazards).

**Core Process:** Hazard Analysis.

**Contribution:** The operationalization of scientific workflows. The project bridges the gap between raw source data (Copernicus Sentinel) and validated research methodologies by codifying the complex, manual analysis steps typically performed by researchers, into a suite of open-source, reusable, and scalable software components (e.g., CLI tools, libraries, APIs).

**Benefits:** Eliminates Redundant Effort, Standardizes Analysis, Accelerates Discovery.

## Key Dependencies

**Imagery Data:** Sentinel products from Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE).
